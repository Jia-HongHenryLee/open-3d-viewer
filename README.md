Program
=======
This program is based on https://code.google.com/p/open-3d-viewer/ which is
used as the basis for the [Zygote Body Browser](http://zygotebody.com/)
(previously called the Google Body Browser). So far very few changes to the
code have been made, but there are plans to develop it further.

Samples
-------
The models provided in web/models are cellular models instead of anatomy
examples like the original open-3d-viewer.


Online Version
--------------
You can go to [webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu](http://webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu/)
for an online-usable version of the program (called "Whole Cell Viewer" there).
